# Linear-Regression

This model uses a data set with one input feature: humidity. I used it to predict the output target: temperature. The data set was split into training (80%) and test (20%).

There were 3 different approaches used: 
- A model from scratch using Numpy
- Two models using SkLearn modules: 
  - SGDRegressor
  - RandomForest


In all three, an error of approximately 4 degrees was observed.
